# Spring Boot Security Example

As Spring Security is a framework that tries to satisfy all possible needs, it is highly customizable. This is a 
double-edged sword, as it can be quite complex to configure and understand. Therefore, I built this example repository
to show how to use Spring Security in a simple way. Please be cautious, that parts of this example might be deprecated
in future Spring versions and I tried to simplify many things to make it easier to understand.
